/*
 * Given an unsorted integer array nums,
 *  return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) 
auxiliary space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

        //that negatives and elements greater than the size of 
        //the array are ignored, while applying cycle sort, and 
        //rest is the similar code of cycle sort
